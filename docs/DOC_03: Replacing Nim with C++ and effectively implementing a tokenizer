Focus: Actually implementing a tokenizer from scratch while drastically changing
the project's architecture due to the lack of Nim support on most IDEs.

Why ditching Nim may actually be helpful despite its interesting features
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Well, I must state I really tried to make use of Nim considering this project. 
However, several occurrences really made using Nim a burden rather than a clever
choice. I could not code consistently until now due to me being ill until a couple
days ago. Also holiday season came, making my deadline even tighter. After all, 
while being my intellectual propriety, I really need this solution to work in order to
solve a task my internship supervisor is stuck with. Finally, I was facing some issues
with my old Linux setup and, thus, I had to adopt Arch Linux so as to achieve what I
was looking for, both functionally and aesthetically. The Arch configuration process
taught me much, but at a high temporal cost of around a week. I then found myself 
unable to correctly setup Nim on any of the IDEs I've tried. The lack of autocompletion, documentation and even syntax highlighting made it a rather unpleasant
experience to deal with. After doing a bit of research, C++ seemed like a better 
option, in spite of its relative complexity. It is very well supported by most of
my favorite IDEs out of the box while also being quite familiar as I spent a lot of
time studying it over the last few years.

Moving forward with my solution and sticking to the UML diagrams I've made   
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I have made some UML diagrams in order to help me understand the abstract nature of 
this solution. Before deciding to adopt C++ I was going to begin implementing the
tokenization bit of the project. I don't see the need for refactoring my previous
code any further. Now I'll add the diagrams to the documentation and follow as it
shows.
